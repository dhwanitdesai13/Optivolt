**Project Overview**
This project focuses on predicting the degradation of Electric Vehicle (EV) batteries using a machine learning model. The degradation of EV batteries is influenced by various factors such as driving behavior, environmental conditions, and charging patterns. By leveraging these factors, we can predict the remaining lifespan of the battery and help optimize battery usage and maintenance for EV owners and manufacturers.

**Key Features**
Predictive Model: A machine learning model was developed to predict the degradation of EV batteries based on key inputs like driving behavior (e.g., speed, acceleration), environmental factors (e.g., temperature, humidity), and charging patterns (e.g., charging frequency, charging duration).

Machine Learning Algorithms: Random Forest and Regression models were used to achieve high accuracy in predicting battery lifespan. These models were trained on a dataset of historical battery data, including usage and environmental parameters, to predict how a battery will degrade over time.

Streamlit Web App: An interactive Streamlit web application was created to provide real-time predictions based on user input. The web app allows users to enter their driving behavior, environmental factors, and charging patterns to receive an estimate of their EV batteryâ€™s remaining lifespan and degradation level.

Real-Time Predictions: The app delivers real-time predictions, giving EV owners insights into the health of their battery and suggesting optimization strategies to extend its lifespan.

Deployment: The model and web app have been deployed on GitHub for easy access, with clear instructions for setup and usage.

**Technologies Used**
Python: The core programming language used to build the model and Streamlit app.

Machine Learning Libraries:

Random Forest: Used for its ability to handle large datasets and make accurate predictions.

Regression Models: For continuous prediction of battery degradation over time.

Streamlit: To create an interactive, user-friendly web app interface.

GitHub: For deployment and version control.
